# python-webscraper

Right now, it's empty. However, idea is to **legally** scrape job postings from LinkedIn or Google (depending which one is free and has easy API) and display it to a user via user interface.

Tech stacks are Playwright, Django/Flask and React + Vite for local dev. All subjects to change, I suppose. Idk, what I'm doing but I got an idea.

### Requirements

- Playwright
- Django
- React + Vite
