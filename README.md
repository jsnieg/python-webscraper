# python-webscraper

Right now, it's empty. 

Shifting focus from creating a web scraper of job postings to something more **free**, **legal** and **easier** from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) which does not infringe on user's private data and displays it onto a React front-end with Python back-end by pressing a button 'Scrape'. As I have found a major roadblock and most internet devs struggled in creating a scraper of latter idea. I want to learn and not rip my hair out.

Tech stacks are Django/Flask and React + Vite for local dev. All subjects to change, I suppose. Idk, what I'm doing but I got an idea.

### Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- Django
- Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- React + Vite
- Colorama (console text color)
- BeautifulSoup
- AIOHTTP
